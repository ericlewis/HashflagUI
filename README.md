# HashflagUI
Inspired by [@wongmjane](https://twitter.com/wongmjane) this is a study based off of [her work](https://wongmjane.com/hashflag-browser) written using purely SwiftUI & CoreData.

## Purpose
To serve as a fun explorative ground for all things SwiftUI across all the platforms.

## Goals
Nothing in specific, if you want to take this any direction just open a PR.

## License
MIT, someone should open a PR to include that :eyes:

## Disclaimer
Not affiliated with twitter nor could I promise they condone this app. Use modify, steal- at your own risk. I also do not claim this code is good.
